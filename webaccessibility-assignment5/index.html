        <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>

          Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world
          are proud, independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt
          for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from
          renowned documentary, The Jungle Book.
        </p>

        <!-- Replaced <br><br> with a paragraph tag -->
        <p>
          So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray
          them with such a skewed vision? In this article we try to answer those
          questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of bear</h3>

        <!-- Replaced <br><br> with a paragraph tag -->
        <p>
          Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small
          bears. If you have seen a small bear, then it was in fact probably a
          baby bear (cub) from another species.
        </p>

        <!-- Replaced <br><br> with a paragraph tag -->
        <p>
          Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large
          and medium bears are just as at home in urban areas as they are in the
          countryside. Different habitats encourange different behaviour
          however, as you'll find out below. The below table also gives you some
          useful facts about bears.
        </p>

        <table>
          <!-- Added a caption to summarize the table for screen readers -->
          <caption>
            Information about different types of bears and their characteristics
          </caption>

            </tr>

        </table>

        <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>

        <!-- Replaced <br><br> with a paragraph tag -->
        <p>
          Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other
          naturally growing ingredients. In general they will hunt for food
          themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down
          their sustenance from farms or country houses. They tend to live in
          relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.
        </p>

        <!-- Replaced <br><br> with a paragraph tag -->
        <p>
          Urban (gentrified) bears on the other hand have largely abandoned the
          old ways. They will hunt other urban creatures if necessary (including
          other predators like rats and foxes), but prefer to scavenge from
          readily available urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast
          food joints. When food has proven scarce, urban bears have even been
          known to break into people's kitchens and steal essentials like baked
          beans, ready meals, and microwave ovens.
        </p>

        />

        <!-- Replaced <br><br> with a paragraph tag -->
        <p>
          Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks,
          to the toilets in McDonalds, to their own apartment.
        </p>

        <h3>Mating rituals</h3>

        <!-- Replaced <br><br> with a paragraph tag -->
        <p>
          Bears are romantic creatures by nature, and will naturally look for a
          mate that they can spend the rest of their lives with. They will woo a
          potential suitor by making their dwelling look attractive — for
          example with cave paintings or a bed of reeds in the case of a wild
          bear, and mood lighting and a Michael Bublé CD in the case of an urban
          bear.

            <p>
              Evan Wild is an unemployed plumber from Doncaster, who has been
              really "in to" wildlife since childhood. He once went to Chester
              Zoo on holiday, but got ill after eating a doner kebab.
            </p>

            <p>
              He has never seen a bear, but once read a Daily Mail article about
              them, and thinks they sound cool.

                  Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry
                  guys in the woods. With their sniffing little noses and their
                  bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of
                  putting them all in a truck and driving them outta here. I run
                  a zoo, you know.
